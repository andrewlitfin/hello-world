Learning how to use GitHub

Hello there!
I'm completely new to the glorious world of GitHub, so I'm just following this handy tutorial I found.

the Magnitude of a vector, commonly denoted ||__x__||, is the pythagorean theorem in n dimensional space.

Dot product is __x__ &middot; __y__

Cross product is __x__ &times; __y__

#Vector Projection

Projection is a useful operation with many applications.

Given two vectors __x__ and __y__, the projection of __x__ onto __y__, commonly denoted proj<sub>__y__</sub>(__x__) or __x__<sub>||__y__</sub>, is a scalar multiple of __y__ based on the length of __x__ in the direction of __y__. It can be calculated as __x__<sub>||__y__</sub> = ((__x__ &middot; __y__) / (__y__ &middot; __y__)) __y__

The Rejection operation is also introduced. Commonly denoted __x__<sub>&perp;__y__</sub>, it is the vector orthogonal to __y__ in the same half-space as __x__ with magnitude equal to the component of __x__ in that direction. It is more easily calculated as __x__<sub>&perp;__y__</sub> = __x__ - __x__<sub>||__y__</sub>.

Given vectors __x__, __y__, and __z__, the scalar triple product is \[__x__, __y__, __z__\] = (__x__ &times; __y__) &middot; __z__.
